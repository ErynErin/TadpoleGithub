# The Pond
The Pond

“In the stillness of a pond alongside his tadpole siblings, Ted navigates the strange new world he’s 
born into. Explore forests of aquatic plants, eat, play, and meet strange creatures not too dissimilar 
to our protagonist, as he dreams of the day he gets to leave this world for the great, mysterious skies 
above the water.

That is, until an inspection of a strange object hints at a greater threat — and it's poisoning the pond. 
The forests grow sparse and the water turns grey and murky. Uncover the true source of this sickness with 
Ted in this fable-like adventure as he races towards the adulthood that is sure to save him from his doomed home.”

The Pond is an action-adventure platformer inspired by the quiet narrative experience of games such as 
Hollow Knight and Rain World. It tells the story of a tadpole experiencing the gradual death of its home 
caused by excessive water pollution. The players go through the game trying to find enough food to survive 
each of the tadpole’s life cycles, all the while the world grows more and more hostile. They must do 
whatever they can to make it to adulthood, and that includes using whatever - whoever - is right in 
front of them.
